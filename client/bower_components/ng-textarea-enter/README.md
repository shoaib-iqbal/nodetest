AngularJS Module to enable action trigger for textarea on pressing the ``enter`` key. 

It removes the default behaviour of creating a new line, when ``enter`` key is pressed against any textarea element, instead as soon as the ``enter`` key is pressed, the method attached to the directive can be called and can be used to access the model associated with the textarea element. 

To create usual newlines, a combination of ``shift+enter``, ``ctrl+enter`` and ``alt+enter`` keys can be used.

### [Demo on CodePen](http://codepen.io/amdsouza92/pen/pyNMjQ)

## Installation

#### CDN 

Use ng-textarea-enter directly from jsdelivr CDN

```html
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/angular.textarea-enter/0.1.6/ng-textarea-enter.min.js
```

#### via bower

You can install the package using bower. Make sure you have bower installed, then run : 

```html
bower install ng-textarea-enter
```

#### via npm

```html
npm install ng-textarea-enter
```

Or, [download](https://github.com/ArunMichaelDsouza/ng-textarea-enter/releases) the latest version and include ``ng-textarea-enter.min.js`` to your project.

Add ``ngTextareaEnter`` as a dependency in your angular app module.

## Usage

Add the directive as an attribute to any textarea element and pass in a method, which will be called on pressing the ``enter`` key.

Example - 
```html
<textarea ng-model="textareaModel" ng-textarea-enter="textareaAction()"></textarea>
```

```javascript
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['ngTextareaEnter']);

myApp.controller('myCtrl', ['$scope', function($scope) {
    $scope.textareaAction = funciton() {
    	console.log($scope.textareaModel);
	};
}]);
```

Now everytime ``enter`` key is pressed against this textarea, the ``textareaAction()`` will be called, no newline will be created. In this case it is logging the value of scope variable ``textareaModel`` out to the console.
